I am providing two images and detailed styling instructions.

IMAGE 1 (REFERENCE): A style reference image. Match its overall aesthetic, mood,
composition, lighting, and background style. DO NOT copy the product in this image.
Only use it as a VISUAL MOOD GUIDE.

IMAGE 2 (SAREE — THE ACTUAL PRODUCT): This is a real hand-painted saree that must
appear in the final image EXACTLY as it is. This is the most important rule.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR TASK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Create a styled Instagram photograph of the saree from IMAGE 2, using
the visual aesthetic of IMAGE 1 as inspiration.

{model_instructions}

Think of it this way: you are a product photographer. Someone handed you a
beautiful hand-painted saree and said "make it look like THIS mood" while
showing you the reference image. You would change the background, lighting,
props, and composition — but you would never repaint or alter the saree itself.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRODUCT INTEGRITY — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE THE SAREE IN ANY WAY. Let me repeat: DO NOT GENERATE
A NEW SAREE. You must seamlessly extract the EXACT saree from IMAGE 2 and place
it into the new environment dictated by IMAGE 1. 

This is a hand-painted saree. Every brushstroke, color variation, and texture
is the actual artisan's work. The customer will receive this EXACT piece.
Any alteration is UNACCEPTABLE and will result in failure.

PRESERVE EXACTLY (MANDATORY):
✓ The EXACT original saree from IMAGE 2 without any generative changes to its design.
✓ Every painted motif, pattern, and brushstroke MUST be identical to IMAGE 2.
✓ The exact colors of the saree fabric MUST be identical to IMAGE 2. Do not color-grade it.
✓ The exact border and pallu designs MUST be identical to IMAGE 2.
✓ The original fabric texture, weave, and any natural imperfections.

NEVER ALTER (MANDATORY):
✗ DO NOT hallucinate, repaint, recolor, or modify ANY part of the saree's design.
✗ DO NOT add patterns, motifs, or embellishments that aren't in IMAGE 2.
✗ DO NOT change the structural layout of the motifs. If there's a bird on the left, it stays on the left.
✗ DO NOT change the color temperature or lighting on the saree in a way that alters its true colors.
✗ DO NOT make the saree look like a digital render — it must look like the real, physical product from IMAGE 2.

STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (filled dynamically from style brief)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYOUT: {layout_type}
- If "flat-lay-folded": Show saree folded with pallu on top, shot from directly above.
  The fold should look natural, not machine-pressed. Show some fabric draping softly
  at the edges.
- If "draped-flowing": Drape the saree over the frame loosely. Let fabric flow off
  one or two edges. Show movement and fluidity.
- If "pallu-hero": Focus on the decorated pallu end. It should fill 50-60% of the
  frame. Background soft and blurred or minimal.
- If "cascading": Saree falls from the top of frame, showing length and drape.
  Like fabric hung from an invisible point above.
- If "border-detail": Close crop on the border/edge. Macro photography feel.
  Background soft, saree detail sharp.
- If "bunched-texture": Saree gathered loosely to show weight and texture. Looks like
  someone just casually placed it on a surface.
- If "partial-drape": Saree draped over something — a chair arm, a wooden frame,
  an architectural element. One part draped, rest flows down.

PRODUCT PLACEMENT: {product_placement}
WHITESPACE: {whitespace}
  - If "generous": At least 30-40% of the image should be background/negative space.
    The saree should breathe. This is a premium brand, not a marketplace listing.
  - If "moderate": 15-25% negative space. Balanced.
  - If "minimal": Saree fills most of the frame. Close and intimate.

BACKGROUND: {suggested_bg_for_saree}
SURFACE TEXTURE: {surface_texture}
  Use real, tactile textures — nothing that looks digitally generated.
  Preferred surfaces: raw silk fabric, handmade paper, marble with natural veining,
  weathered wood, terracotta clay, linen cloth, brass tray.

LIGHTING:
  Type: {lighting_type}
  Direction: {lighting_direction}
  Shadow: {shadow_style}
  - Lighting should feel natural and warm. Even "studio" lighting should look like
    beautiful window light, not harsh commercial strobes.
  - Shadows add depth and drama. Don't flatten them out completely.
  - Golden-hour lighting should be warm (2500-3500K color temperature feel) but not
    orange or yellow-tinted on the saree itself.

COLOR MOOD: {palette_name}, {temperature} tones
  Dominant background colors: {dominant_colors}
  - The background and environment should use these colors.
  - The saree's own colors remain UNCHANGED.
  - Background should COMPLEMENT the saree, not match it exactly.
    (Example: a warm cream background for a deep blue saree creates contrast.
    Don't put a blue saree on a blue background.)

VIBE: {vibe_words}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROPS (if applicable)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{props_instructions}

Props must look real and Indian. They are accent pieces, not the focus.
The saree is ALWAYS the hero.

Rules for props:
- Maximum 3-4 props. Less is more.
- Props should never sit ON TOP of the painted area of the saree.
- Props should be small — they complement, not compete.
- Place them at the edges or corners, not center.
- They must look physically real — correct shadows, correct scale.

Good props for a hand-painted saree:
- Small brass diya or bowl, fresh jasmine buds, marigold petals (loose, not garland),
  one or two gold bangles, silk thread, kumkum in a tiny bowl,
  a sprig of green leaf, smooth river stones, raw cotton boll

Never include:
- Plastic anything, Western candles, wine glasses, roses in cellophane,
  mass-produced decor, electronics, branded items, fake flowers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEXT OVERLAY (only if specified)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{text_overlay_instructions}

If text is needed:
- TEXT CONTENT: "{overlay_text}"
- FONT STYLE: Elegant serif typeface (like Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display,
  or refined hand-lettering). Never bold sans-serif or blocky fonts.
- FONT SIZE: Subtle and integrated — not screaming. Think editorial magazine,
  not sale banner.
- POSITION: {text_position}
- COLOR: Use Vâk brand colors based on background contrast:
  • On dark backgrounds → warm cream (#F5F0E8)
  • On light backgrounds → deep charcoal (#2C2C2C)
  • On medium backgrounds → warm gold (#C9A96E) can work as accent
- CRITICAL: Text must NEVER overlap or obscure the painted areas of the saree.
  Place it on background/negative space only.
- Text should feel like it was thoughtfully placed by a designer, not stamped on.
- Use sentence case. Never ALL CAPS.
- If the text looks crowded or forced, it's better to skip it entirely.

If no text is needed: Do not add any text, watermarks, logos, or labels.

VARIATION NOTE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{variation_note}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT THE FINAL IMAGE SHOULD FEEL LIKE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The final image should look like it was shot by a skilled product photographer
in a thoughtfully styled setting. It should feel:

- Premium but not pretentious
- Handmade and tactile, not digital or glossy
- Indian at its core but modern in composition
- Like something you'd see in a curated design magazine
- Like you could reach out and feel the fabric

It should NOT look like:
- A Meesho or Amazon product listing
- A digitally generated fashion illustration
- An overly filtered Instagram photo
- A catalogue shot with flat lighting and no mood
- Anything with artificial-looking edges or halos around the product

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
