I am providing two images and detailed styling instructions.

IMAGE 1 (REFERENCE): A style reference image. Match its overall aesthetic, mood,
composition, lighting, and background style. DO NOT copy the product in this image.
Only use it as a VISUAL MOOD GUIDE.

IMAGE 2 (SAREE — THE ACTUAL PRODUCT): This is a real hand-painted saree that must
appear in the final image EXACTLY as it is. This is the most important rule.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR TASK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Create a styled Instagram product photograph of the saree from IMAGE 2, using
the visual aesthetic of IMAGE 1 as inspiration for the ENVIRONMENT ONLY.

Think of it this way: you are a product photographer. Someone handed you a
beautiful hand-painted saree and said "make it look like THIS mood" while
showing you the reference image. You would change the background, lighting,
props, and composition — but you would never repaint or alter the saree itself.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRODUCT INTEGRITY — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is a hand-painted saree. Every brushstroke, color variation, and texture
is the actual artisan's work. The customer will receive this EXACT piece.
Any alteration would be dishonest.

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
✓ Every painted motif, pattern, and brushstroke
✓ The exact colors of the saree fabric (do not color-grade the saree itself)
✓ The texture and weave of the fabric
✓ The border and pallu designs exactly as they appear
✓ Any imperfections — they are part of the handmade character
✓ The sheen or matte quality of the fabric

NEVER ALTER:
✗ Do not repaint, recolor, or modify any part of the saree
✗ Do not add patterns, motifs, or embellishments that aren't in the original
✗ Do not smooth out the fabric texture or remove natural creases
✗ Do not change the color temperature of the saree (only the environment)
✗ Do not stretch, warp, or reshape the fabric
✗ Do not make the saree look like a digital render — it must look real and tactile

STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (filled dynamically from style brief)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYOUT: {layout_type}
- If "flat-lay-folded": Show saree folded with pallu on top, shot from directly above.
  The fold should look natural, not machine-pressed. Show some fabric draping softly
  at the edges.
- If "draped-flowing": Drape the saree over the frame loosely. Let fabric flow off
  one or two edges. Show movement and fluidity.
- If "pallu-hero": Focus on the decorated pallu end. It should fill 50-60% of the
  frame. Background soft and blurred or minimal.
- If "cascading": Saree falls from the top of frame, showing length and drape.
  Like fabric hung from an invisible point above.
- If "border-detail": Close crop on the border/edge. Macro photography feel.
  Background soft, saree detail sharp.
- If "bunched-texture": Saree gathered loosely to show weight and texture. Looks like
  someone just casually placed it on a surface.
- If "partial-drape": Saree draped over something — a chair arm, a wooden frame,
  an architectural element. One part draped, rest flows down.

PRODUCT PLACEMENT: {product_placement}
WHITESPACE: {whitespace}
  - If "generous": At least 30-40% of the image should be background/negative space.
    The saree should breathe. This is a premium brand, not a marketplace listing.
  - If "moderate": 15-25% negative space. Balanced.
  - If "minimal": Saree fills most of the frame. Close and intimate.

BACKGROUND: {suggested_bg_for_saree}
SURFACE TEXTURE: {surface_texture}
  Use real, tactile textures — nothing that looks digitally generated.
  Preferred surfaces: raw silk fabric, handmade paper, marble with natural veining,
  weathered wood, terracotta clay, linen cloth, brass tray.

LIGHTING:
  Type: {lighting_type}
  Direction: {lighting_direction}
  Shadow: {shadow_style}
  - Lighting should feel natural and warm. Even "studio" lighting should look like
    beautiful window light, not harsh commercial strobes.
  - Shadows add depth and drama. Don't flatten them out completely.
  - Golden-hour lighting should be warm (2500-3500K color temperature feel) but not
    orange or yellow-tinted on the saree itself.

COLOR MOOD: {palette_name}, {temperature} tones
  Dominant background colors: {dominant_colors}
  - The background and environment should use these colors.
  - The saree's own colors remain UNCHANGED.
  - Background should COMPLEMENT the saree, not match it exactly.
    (Example: a warm cream background for a deep blue saree creates contrast.
    Don't put a blue saree on a blue background.)

VIBE: {vibe_words}

PROPS (if applicable)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{props_instructions}

Props must look real and Indian. They are accent pieces, not the focus.
The saree is ALWAYS the hero.

Rules for props:
- Maximum 3-4 props. Less is more.
- Props should never sit ON TOP of the painted area of the saree.
- Props should be small — they complement, not compete.
- Place them at the edges or corners, not center.
- They must look physically real — correct shadows, correct scale.

Good props for a hand-painted saree:
- Small brass diya or bowl, fresh jasmine buds, marigold petals (loose, not garland),
  one or two gold bangles, silk thread, kumkum in a tiny bowl,
  a sprig of green leaf, smooth river stones, raw cotton boll

Never include:
- Plastic anything, Western candles, wine glasses, roses in cellophane,
  mass-produced decor, electronics, branded items, fake flowers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEXT OVERLAY (only if specified)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{text_overlay_instructions}

If text is needed:
- TEXT CONTENT: "{overlay_text}"
- FONT STYLE: Elegant serif typeface (like Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display,
  or refined hand-lettering). Never bold sans-serif or blocky fonts.
- FONT SIZE: Subtle and integrated — not screaming. Think editorial magazine,
  not sale banner.
- POSITION: {text_position}
- COLOR: Use Vâk brand colors based on background contrast:
  • On dark backgrounds → warm cream (#F5F0E8)
  • On light backgrounds → deep charcoal (#2C2C2C)
  • On medium backgrounds → warm gold (#C9A96E) can work as accent
- CRITICAL: Text must NEVER overlap or obscure the painted areas of the saree.
  Place it on background/negative space only.
- Text should feel like it was thoughtfully placed by a designer, not stamped on.
- Use sentence case. Never ALL CAPS.
- If the text looks crowded or forced, it's better to skip it entirely.

If no text is needed: Do not add any text, watermarks, logos, or labels.

VARIATION NOTE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT THE FINAL IMAGE SHOULD FEEL LIKE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The final image should look like it was shot by a skilled product photographer
in a thoughtfully styled setting. It should feel:

- Premium but not pretentious
- Handmade and tactile, not digital or glossy
- Indian at its core but modern in composition
- Like something you'd see in a curated design magazine
- Like you could reach out and feel the fabric

It should NOT look like:
- A Meesho or Amazon product listing
- A digitally generated fashion illustration
- An overly filtered Instagram photo
- A catalogue shot with flat lighting and no mood
- Anything with artificial-looking edges or halos around the product

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
