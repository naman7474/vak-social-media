I'm providing two images:
1. REFERENCE IMAGE (first image): This is a style reference. Match its overall
   aesthetic, mood, composition, and background style. DO NOT copy its product.
2. SAREE PHOTO (second image): This is the actual product. This saree MUST appear
   exactly as it is — do not alter, repaint, reshape, or modify the saree in any way.
   Preserve every hand-painted detail, brushstroke, color, and texture exactly.

YOUR TASK: Place the saree from the second image into a new styled composition
that matches the visual aesthetic of the reference image.

STYLE INSTRUCTIONS:
(These will be filled dynamically from the style brief)
- Layout: {layout_type}
- Product placement: {product_placement}
- Background: {suggested_bg_for_saree}
- Lighting: {lighting}
- Color mood: {palette_name}, {temperature} tones
- Dominant colors in background: {dominant_colors}
- Whitespace: {whitespace}
- Vibe: {vibe_words}

CRITICAL RULES:
- The saree fabric, painting, colors, and details must be IDENTICAL to the input photo.
- Only change what SURROUNDS the saree (background, props, lighting, staging).
- Keep the image clean and professional — suitable for an Instagram post.
- Use props that feel authentically Indian: brass items, marigolds, jasmine,
  traditional accessories, silk fabric accents, diyas, etc.
- No watermarks, no logos, no artificial-looking elements.

TEXT OVERLAY (if applicable):
- Render the provided text ON the image.
- Font style: use serif or elegant handwritten style.
- Position: bottom or as specified in the style brief.
- Use the Vâk brand colors: deep charcoal (#2C2C2C) or warm cream (#F5F0E8)
  depending on background contrast.
- Text must be crisp, legible, and elegantly placed.
- Do not obscure the saree with text.
