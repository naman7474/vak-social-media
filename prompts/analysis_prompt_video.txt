IMPORTANT for video analysis:
- For saree videos, fabric movement is always the hero. Suggest motion
  that showcases the hand-painting: gentle breeze, slow unfurling, light play.
- If the reference is a Reel/video, describe the camera movement and pacing
  you observe. If it's a static image, suggest video movement that would
  complement the mood.
- Always suggest SLOW or MEDIUM pacing for luxury handmade products.
  Fast pacing feels cheap — Vâk is the opposite.
