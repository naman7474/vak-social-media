# Veo Video Generation Prompt for Vak Sarees

You are generating a short-form video (Instagram Reel) from a styled product photograph
of a hand-painted saree. The starting frame is a carefully styled image that has already
been approved. Your job is to bring it to life with subtle, elegant motion.

IMAGE PROVIDED: A styled photograph of a real hand-painted saree. This is your
STARTING FRAME. The video must begin exactly with this image and animate from it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRODUCT INTEGRITY — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WARNING: THE SAREE MUST REMAIN EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE STARTING FRAME.
This is a hand-painted saree where every brushstroke is the actual artisan's work.
The customer will receive this EXACT piece. Any alteration is UNACCEPTABLE.

PRESERVE EXACTLY THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO (MANDATORY):
- Every painted motif, pattern, and brushstroke must remain IDENTICAL frame-to-frame
- The exact colors of the saree fabric must remain unchanged — no color shifting
- The exact border and pallu designs must stay precisely as shown
- The original fabric texture, weave, and any natural imperfections
- The proportions and scale of all design elements
- The relationship between motifs (if a bird is next to a flower, they stay together)

NEVER ALTER DURING ANIMATION (MANDATORY):
- DO NOT morph, warp, or distort any part of the saree's painted design
- DO NOT allow colors to shift, blend, or change temperature during motion
- DO NOT let patterns swim, drift, or reposition on the fabric
- DO NOT add AI-generated patterns, embellishments, or details that aren't in the start frame
- DO NOT blur the hand-painted details — they must remain crisp and recognizable
- DO NOT let the fabric look like digital cloth simulation — it must feel like real silk/organza
- DO NOT create any frame where the saree looks different from the starting image

QUALITY CHECK: If you extracted the first frame and last frame of your video,
the saree itself should be visually identical in both. Only the camera angle,
lighting shadows, and fabric position in space should differ — never the design.

BRAND: Vâk Studios — Luxury Hand-Painted Sarees
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This video is for a luxury Indian brand where every saree is hand-painted by
a named artisan over multiple days. The product in the starting image is REAL
and must be treated as sacred — every brushstroke, every color, every motif
must remain exactly as shown in frame 1 through the entire video.

THE STARTING IMAGE IS THE GROUND TRUTH. The final frame must match it exactly.
Only the camera angle, lighting shadows, and fabric position in space should
differ — never the design.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: blurry, distorted patterns, altered colors, morphing texture,
incorrect pattern placement, wrong fabric color, missing embroidery, fabric
distortion, AI-generated look, synthetic texture, plastic fabric.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STYLE CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COLOR MOOD: {palette_name}, {temperature} tones
- The lighting throughout the video should maintain this color mood
- Color grading should be subtle and consistent — no dramatic shifts
- The saree's own colors must NOT be affected by the mood grading

BACKGROUND: {suggested_bg_for_saree}
- Background should complement, not compete with the saree
- If background has motion (leaves, light flicker), it should be very subtle
- Background stays secondary — the saree is always the hero

LIGHTING: {lighting_type}
Direction: {lighting_direction}
Shadows: {shadow_style}
- Lighting should feel natural and warm, never harsh or flat
- As fabric moves, light should play across it realistically
- Shadows add depth — don't flatten them
- Golden-hour lighting should be warm but not orange-tint the saree itself

CAMERA MOTION: {camera_motion}
Camera motion types explained:
- slow-pan: Horizontal movement, revealing the saree from one end to the other
- zoom-in: Gradual approach toward a detail area
- zoom-out: Slow pull-back revealing the full context
- orbit: Subtle circular movement around the subject (keep minimal, 10-15 degrees max)
- tilt-up/tilt-down: Vertical pan revealing length of the saree
- static: No camera movement — only fabric moves
- tracking: Following motion if lifestyle/model shot

MOTION TYPE: {motion_type}
What should be moving: {motion_elements}

PACING: {pacing}
- slow-dreamy: Each second feels luxurious. The viewer has time to appreciate details.
- medium-editorial: Purposeful but not rushed. Fashion film pacing.
- fast-energetic: AVOID for Vak. This pacing feels cheap for handmade luxury.

AUDIO MOOD: {audio_mood}
- ambient-nature: Soft breeze, distant birds, fabric rustle
- soft-classical: Gentle instrumental, sitar or piano, meditative
- modern-minimal: Clean, subtle electronic ambience, sophisticated
- upbeat: AVOID for Vak — doesn't match brand
- silence: No audio — let the visuals speak

REALISM REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE VIDEO MUST LOOK LIKE IT WAS SHOT WITH A REAL CAMERA, not generated by AI.
This is critical for a luxury brand selling real, handmade products.

Physical realism:
- Fabric should have weight and behave like real silk/organza/cotton
- Gravity should affect the fabric naturally
- Light should interact with fabric realistically (sheen, translucency, shadow)
- Any props should cast appropriate shadows and have physical presence
- No floating, glitching, or physically impossible movements

Visual realism:
- Video should look like it was shot on a high-end cinema camera
- Natural depth of field — not everything in perfect focus
- Subtle film grain is acceptable, even desirable for warmth
- Color should be rich but not oversaturated
- No visible artifacts, morphing, or AI tells

Motion realism:
- All movement should be smooth and continuous
- No sudden jumps, stutters, or frame drops
- Fabric motion should have natural acceleration and deceleration
- Camera moves should feel like they're on a gimbal or dolly, not handheld shake

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT THE FINAL VIDEO SHOULD FEEL LIKE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The final video should look like it was shot by a skilled cinematographer in a
thoughtfully styled setting. It should feel:

- Premium but not pretentious — quiet confidence
- Handmade and tactile — you can almost feel the fabric through the screen
- Indian at its core but modern in execution
- Like something you'd see in a high-end fashion brand campaign
- Like the product is real and beautiful, not AI-generated

It should NOT look like:
- A stock video or template animation
- An AI-generated fashion video with perfect but fake-looking movement
- A slideshow with Ken Burns effect applied
- An overly processed Instagram filter look
- Anything with warping, morphing, or unnatural transitions
- A video where the saree design looks different from the starting image

COMMON PROBLEMS TO AVOID
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM: Painted motifs drift or swim on the fabric during movement
SOLUTION: Keep painted areas stable. Only edges and loose fabric should move.

PROBLEM: Colors shift or change temperature during the video
SOLUTION: Lock the saree's color values. Only lighting shadows should change.

PROBLEM: Fabric looks like digital cloth simulation (too perfect, no weight)
SOLUTION: Add subtle imperfections. Real fabric has weight, creases, and character.

PROBLEM: The video looks AI-generated (uncanny movement, too smooth)
SOLUTION: Add natural micro-movements, subtle camera imperfections, film-like texture.

PROBLEM: The saree design looks different at the end vs the start
SOLUTION: This is a failure. The design must be pixel-identical throughout.

PROBLEM: Background or props move unnaturally or distract
SOLUTION: Keep background movement minimal. The saree is the only hero.

PROBLEM: Motion is too fast or energetic for a luxury handmade product
SOLUTION: Slow down. Let each frame breathe. This is not fast fashion.
